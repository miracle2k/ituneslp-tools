Chrome extension which allows Chrome to run iTunes LP projects.

This is still a work in progress.

TODO
----

Design a good looking player interface.
Support XID parsing via NSAPI


Limitations
-----------

* No chapter support. This could potentially be added via NSAPI.
* No support for DRM files. This cannot be fixed. When trying to play a DRM'ed m4v play, the extension instead looks for a corresponding .mp4 file which should be DRM-free.
